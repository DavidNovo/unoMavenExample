unoMavenExample
===============

This is my first project with Hadoop.  I canted to create the smallest POM that could create code that would run on Hadoop.  It works.

Here is the command to run the code:
 ./hadoop jar unoMavenExample-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar net.novogrodsky.CardDriver cardinput.txt output.txt
